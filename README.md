36. You recently read a blog post about the merits of using short sentences while writing. The article inspires you to write a program which will print the number of words in a sentence. When the exercise below is run, it will ask you to type a sentence in one line. The code will then split the sentence into words and store them in an ArrayList called 'words'. You have to write code that will print the number of items in the ArrayList. What we expect: If the line entered when the program is run is: "The brown fox is really lazy" We expect your code to print the number 6 to the system console. We'll say that a value is "everywhere" in an ArrayList if for every pair of adjacent elements in the List, at least one of the pair is that value. Return true if the given value is everywhere in the array. Ex: if an ArrayList arr has the elements 1,2,1,3 the value 1 is everywhere. 

37. Suppose you have a set “s” containing some strings. Write a code fragment to compute the result of concatenating all of these strings together. 

38. Write a program to i) take a path of a file as input and calculate how many letters are there in that file ii) take a number as input and generate a prime number that is greater than that. In main (), print both the results.

39. Create an Interface call as ConvertToRupee. Create two methods like convertDollorToRupee(), convertPoundsToRupee(). Create a class to implement the interface and convert the entered amount to rupees. Let the user choose which conversion he wants to.

40. Write a program to find average of ‘n’ numbers. Use input through command line argument. The program should read value of ‘n’ first. If the input ‘n’ happens to be zero or negative a suitable user defined exception should be thrown. If the given input is not a valid integer then exception must be thrown. Use suitable try-catch block.

41. Create a package to find roots of a quadratic equation.

42. Write a program to create a class MarksElligible, which is thrown when the marks is less than 20.

43. Create a class Student with attributes roll no, name, age and course. Initialize values through parameterized constructor. If age of student is not in between 15 and 21 then generate user-defined exception "AgeNotWithinRangeException". If name contains numbers or special symbols raise exception "NameNotValidException". Define the two exception classes.

44. Develop a java program to spawn two threads named ‘Odd_prime’ and ’Even_Fibonacci’. Thread “Odd_prime” should print the Odd prime numbers and Thread “Even_Fibonacci” should print the Even Fibonacci numbers between 1 and 100. Display the name, priority &
group name of threads. Use join() method to ensure that Thread “Even_Fibonacci” should not be interrupted by Thread “Odd_Prime”.

45. John wants to develop a multithread program to create three threads named ‘Reverse’, ‘Pyramid’ and Fibonacci’ to perform the following tasks.
a) Thread ‘Reverse’ should reverse the given string and display it.
b) Thread ‘Pyramid’ should display the pyramid of numbers which are multiples of 5.
c) Thread ‘Fibonacci’ should compute the Fibonacci series.

46. Write a java program to display all odd and Even palindrome numbers below 1000.
Requirements:
The program should use 2 interfaces A and B in which A should contain a method Odd_Palindrome() for displaying all odd palindrome numbers and B should have a method Even_Palindrome() to display all the even palindrome numbers below 1000.

48. Develop a multithreaded program by creating three separate threads namely Sort,Average and Search, the Sort thread will perform sorting 10 numbers in an ascending order(apply bubble sort), the Average thread will calculate average of ten numbers and the Search thread will search a key in a given array of integers(linear/binary search). Each thread will perform task concurrently for every five seconds.
